# angle_meter

## This repo contains a number of Arduino sketches which make up some of my tests with various accelerometers.

### Angle_Meter_1
This uses an MMA7660 orientation sensor, which is rather a crude sensor with limited resolution.

### Angle_Meter_2
This uses an ADXL335 Analogue 3-axis accelerometer which provides much finer grained resolution.

### Angle_Meter_3
This uses an ADXL345 Digital 3-axis accelerometer which permits very accurate measurement.
